    <hr />

    <p>I took an interest in code when I was a freshman in highschool.
         I've always admired the "Mysterious hackers" on TV and wanted to be one of them.
         I started off taking classes on code academy then went on to do a Sales-tech program after highschool 
         to get ahead. but that wasn't really my thing either. I came to the conclusion I need to just do it 
         instead of having imposter syndrom. So I signed up for ElevenFifty academy. And I have been over joyed 
         waking up every day to do these assignments. Can't wait to see all your faces on the 13th!</p>
